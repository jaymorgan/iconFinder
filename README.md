# IconFinder

### Find the right icon in Font Awesome

This gives you a searchable, and taggable interface for the Font Awesome icon lybrary. It's like the [Font Awesome Cheatsheet](http://fontawesome.io/cheatsheet/)  

I'm utilizing [DaftMonk/generator-angular-fullstack](https://github.com/DaftMonk/generator-angular-fullstack) and will eventually put it online once I get it to a certain point (depending on how popular it becomes).
